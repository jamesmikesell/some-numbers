# TODO

- persistence of previously played games
- visual indication of failure moves
- clear formatting rows / columns / groups when all required cells are selected, and non-required cells are cleared. Possibly remove header value once a rows/column has been solved.
- ability to pinch to zoom, even on game board controls
- current sum of selected cells in a color group, shown in top right corner perhaps
- temp cell selection:
  - ability to highlight cells temporarily to mark that you're using them for mental math
  - cells are highlighted in consistent color depending on when they were highlighted
  - optionally do math for selected cells
- history of completed boards
- ability to partially solve a board, and save them for later
- stats of fail counts based on grid size
- ability to undo a move, IE un-hide a hidden number, or de-select a selected number
- make game offline capable
- make game a PWA so it can be added to home screen
- app icon
- show game name somewhere on app

# Done

- ensure board display correctly on both portrait and landscape oriented devices
- explain how to play game
- dark/light/auto theme mode toggle
- weed out unsolvable games
- ensure every row/col/group has at least one required cell
- visually signal when game is complete
- buttons to change game number
- current sum of selected col/rows
- change the percent of numbers that are on the board (reduced to 40%)
