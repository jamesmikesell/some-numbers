# TODO

- weed out unsolvable games
- visual indication of failure
- persistence of previously played games
- visually signal when game is complete
- clear formatting rows / columns / groups when all required cells are selected, and non-required cells are cleared.
- ability to pinch to zoom, even on game board controls
- ensure every row/col/group has at least one required cell
- current sum of selected cells in a color group, shown in top right corner perhaps
- temp cell selection:
  - ability to highlight cells temporarily to mark that you're using them for mental math
  - cells are highlighted in consistent color depending on when they were highlighted
  - optionally do math for selected cells
- history of completed boards
- ability to partially solve a board, and save them for later
- stats of fail counts based on grid size
- dark/light/auto toggle
- ability to undo
