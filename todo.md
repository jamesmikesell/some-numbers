# TODO

- investigate possibility that tapping is selecting a character... seems to be searching for "v" which may only be part of the version number display
- make starting seed so that first few games are easy and progressively harder
- persistence of previously played games
  - ability to partially solve a board, and save them for later
- app icon
- show game name somewhere on app / or an app game logo
- make game a PWA so it can be added to home screen
- make game offline capable
- show hints for when people get stuck (Participation Trophy Mode)
- visual indication of failure moves
- clear formatting rows / columns / groups when all required cells are selected, and non-required cells are cleared. Possibly remove header value once a rows/column has been solved.
- ability to pinch to zoom, even on game board controls
- current sum of selected cells in a color group, shown in top right corner perhaps
- temp cell selection:
  - ability to highlight cells temporarily to mark that you're using them for mental math
  - cells are highlighted in consistent color depending on when they were highlighted
  - optionally do math for selected cells
- stats of fail counts based on grid size, time spent per game, per size
- ability to undo a move, IE un-hide a hidden number, or de-select a selected number
- tutorial mode
- affirmation main text doesn't look great on ios
